# KoalAI Project Plan: A GovHack Initiative

## 1. Executive Summary

**Project Name:** KoalAI

**Concept:** A friendly, conversational AI assistant designed to help Australian entrepreneurs navigate the complexities of starting a business. KoalAI will act as a single, trustworthy source of information, integrating data from federal, state, and local governments to provide personalised, step-by-step guidance.

**Governing Framework:** This project will be developed in strict adherence to the **Australian Government AI technical standard** to ensure it is responsible, ethical, transparent, and safe.

**Primary Use Case:** Assisting a user with the life event of "Starting a Business."

## 2. Guiding Principles (Whole of AI Lifecycle)

These principles will be embedded in every stage of the project:

* **Explainability & Transparency:** KoalAI will always clearly state it's an AI and cite the official government sources for the information it provides.
* **Auditability:** All interactions, data sources, and system versions will be logged to ensure full traceability and accountability.
* **Bias Management:** A comprehensive bias management plan will be implemented to actively identify, assess, and mitigate bias in data, algorithms, and testing.
* **Human Oversight:** A "human-in-the-loop" will always be an option. The system will be designed to escalate complex or high-risk queries to a human expert for review.

## 3. Phase 1: Discover (Design, Data, Train, Evaluate)

### Design

* **Problem Definition:** Address the overwhelming complexity aspiring entrepreneurs face when navigating fragmented government regulations and information.
* **Human-Centred Approach:** The design will be co-developed with real entrepreneurs. It will be inclusive, meet **WCAG accessibility standards**, and include clear mechanisms for user feedback.
* **Success Criteria:** Success will be measured using a balanced set of metrics, including **Value-Proposition** (e.g., user-reported confidence), **Performance** (e.g., accuracy), **Bias-Related** (e.g., demographic parity), and **Adoption** (e.g., task completion rate).

### Data

* **Data Advantage:** KoalAI's value comes from its ability to perform **real-time data fusion and integration** from multiple government sources, creating a personalised roadmap for the user.
* **Data Supply Chain:** The system will draw data from:
    * **Federal:** ATO, ASIC, business.gov.au
    * **State/Territory:** State-specific licenses and permits.
    * **Local:** Council zoning and regulations.
* **Data Quality & Validation:** We will use the ABS Data Quality Framework to ensure data is **timely, accurate, and relevant**. Automated validation checks will be implemented.
* **Bias Management:** We will ensure our datasets are representative of the diverse population of Australian entrepreneurs, actively managing for geographic, demographic, and industry-specific biases.

### Train

* **Training Mechanism:** We will use a pre-trained **Large Language Model (LLM)**. The core training technique will be **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ground the model with our curated, trusted government data sources. This minimizes factual errors and allows for source citation.
* **Tools:**
    * **LLM:** An API-accessible model like Google Gemini.
    * **Frameworks:** **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex** to build the RAG application.
    * **Vector Database:** **ChromaDB** or **FAISS** to store and retrieve information.
* **Training Environment:** A secure cloud platform (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure) with strict access controls, adhering to the **ISM** and **Essential Eight**.
* **Model Validation:** The RAG system will be validated for factual correctness, correct source attribution, and fairness across diverse user personas.

### Evaluate

* **Testing Strategy:** Our strategy will include **baseline testing** (comparing AI answers to human experts), robust **regression testing**, and a high degree of automation.
* **Mitigating Bias in Testing:** The process will use **independent testers**, **separate test data** from training data, and a **diverse group of test subjects** for User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
* **Safety and UAT:** We will conduct **adversarial "red team" testing** to identify weaknesses and a final round of **UAT** with real entrepreneurs to validate the web app in real-world scenarios.

## 4. Phase 2: Operate (Integrate, Deploy, Monitor)

### Integration & Deployment

* **Security Approval:** The project must obtain a **Security Authority to Operate (SATO)** before deployment.
* **Phased Roll-out Strategy:**
    1.  **Internal Pilot (Canary Release):** Initial launch to a small group of internal government staff.
    2.  **Private Beta (Blue-Green):** Controlled release to a limited group of real entrepreneurs.
    3.  **Public Launch (Traffic Shifting):** Gradually increase the percentage of public users sent to KoalAI, from 10% to 100%.
* **Safe Rollback:** An **automated rollback mechanism** will be in place to instantly revert to the previous stable version if a critical failure is detected.

### Monitoring

* **Ongoing Monitoring:** We will continuously monitor system health, infrastructure, and performance.
* **AI Drift and Safety:** We will actively monitor for **AI drift** (degradation in accuracy) and any unintended consequences or safety issues, using user feedback as a key input.

## 5. Phase 3: Retire (Decommission)

### Decommissioning Plan

* **Structured Process:** The project will have a decommissioning plan from the start, outlining the scope, impact analysis, and a proactive communication strategy for users.
* **Secure Shutdown:** The plan will detail the technical steps to securely shut down all computing resources, wipe data, and terminate services.
* **Final Reporting:** All compliance records will be retained, and a final report detailing the process and lessons learned will be delivered to stakeholders.
